<strong>Retaining Personal Information

</strong><br>


Safeguarding the privacy of your information is important to us, whether you interact with us personally, by phone, by mail, over the interest or any other electronic device. We hold personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper-based files and other records, and take steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, and modification of disclosure.<br>
<br>
When we consider that personal information is no longer needed, we will remove any details that will identify you or we will securely destroy the records.
However, we may need to maintain records for a significant period of time. For example, we are subject to certain anti-money laundering laws, which require us to retain:<br>
<ul style="list-style:disc !important; padding-left:25px; padding-top:10px;">
<li>A copy of the documents we used to comply with our customer due diligence obligations; and</li>
<li>Supporting evidence and records of transactions with you and your relationship with us;</li>
</ul><br>
For a period of five years after our business relationship with you has ended.<br>
If we hold any personal information in the form of a recorded communication, by telephone, electronic, in person or otherwise, this information will be held in line with local regulatory requirements which will either be 5 years or 10 years after our business relationship with you has ended. <br>
<br>
Where you have opted out of receiving marketing communications we will hold your details on our opt out list so that we know you do not want to receive these communications. 

<br>
<br>
<strong>Security of Personal Information

</strong><br>

We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.<br>
We will store all the personal information you provide on our secure password and firewall-protected servers.<br>
All electronic financial transactions entered into through our website will be protected by encryption technology.<br>
You acknowledge that the transmission of information over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.<br>
You are responsible for keeping the password you use for accessing our website confidential; we will not ask you for your password (except when you log in to our website).

                   
<br>
<br>
<strong>Amendments
</strong>
<br>

We may update this policy from time to time by publishing a new version on our website.<br>
You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes to this policy. As per recent GDPR requirements all current users will be provided with an updated privacy policy email, providing access to this page. 
                   
<br>
<br>
              

<strong>Your Rights</strong><br>

You may instruct us to provide you with any personal information we hold about you; provision of such information will be subject to: the payment of a fee currently fixed at GBP 10; and the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity (for this purpose, we will usually accept a photocopy of your passport certified by a solicitor or bank plus an original copy of a utility bill showing your current address).<br>
<br>
We may withhold personal information that you request to the extent permitted by law.<br>
<br>
